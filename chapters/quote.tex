  ``There is the rubbish we keep, which is the junk, and the rubbish we throw away, which is the garbage.''

  ``We are the eternal return of the enslaved stock under his new name, junkware. \newline
  We are the medium, the message and the code. \newline
  We are worth our code, not worth a rush''
