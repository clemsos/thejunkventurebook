\subsection{Third Hand}

A benefit with recycling is that you don{\textquotedblright}t
{\textquotedblright}reinvent the wheel{\textquotedblright} as we say in
french. But it sticks you to a former thinking. A benefit with creating
is that you free yourself from other{\textquoteright}s tracks and
create you{\textquoteright}r own.

I really like this quotation from Ralph Waldo Emerson, an american poet
: {\textquotedblright}don{\textquotedblright}t go where the path may
lead, go instead where there{\textquoteright}s no path and leave a
trail{\textquotedblright}.

What is junk to me ? Maybe a tiny trail between known and unknown,
creating and recycling, source of inspiration and greasy sticking past.
